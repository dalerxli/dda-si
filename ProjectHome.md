# DDA-SI toolbox for MATLAB #
Discrete dipole approximation (DDA), both for free space  particle(s) light scattering and with planar surface interaction (DDA-SI). Symmetry optimization and T-matrix formulation implemented for free-space DDA will be included in later releases.

Subsequent versions can be downloaded from Scattport:

Please note that some functions from the Optical Tweezers toolbox are required for coordinate transformation, beam shape coefficients (BSCs), vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs), etc.:
